I recently joined a program to further *the PHP community*, called [PHP Mentoring](http://phpmentoring.org/). Its purpose is helping aspiring PHP programmers to improved code quality and best practices.

The declaration of intent sums it up well.

>We are mentors and apprentices, teachers and students, coaches, counselers and friends. We're not in this for profit but for the end result, a strong community of talented developers doing some fabulous work.

Shortly after signing up I was contacted by [Gregor McKelvie](https://twitter.com/gregormckelvie), a PHP programmer from Scotland. He is building a really promising application called [Tracks](http://www.buildtracks.com/) and wanted help improving his object oriented design skills and start applying formal testing.

I am really looking forward to doing this together with Gregor and I believe I will learn a thing or two myself in the process.

If you feel like joining too, just read [the guidelines](http://phpmentoring.org/guidelines.html) and then [go sign up](https://github.com/phpmentoring/phpmentoring.github.com/wiki/Mentors-and-Apprentices)!
